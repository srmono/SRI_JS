Promises and async/await are both mechanisms in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations, but they differ in syntax and usage.

### Promises

1. **Syntax:**
   ```javascript
   const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     // Asynchronous operation
     if (operationSuccessful) {
       resolve(result);
     } else {
       reject(error);
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Chaining:**
   ```javascript
   myPromise
     .then((result) => {
       // Handle resolved state
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle rejected state
     });
   ```

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Error handling is typically done using the `.catch()` method.

### Async/Await

1. **Syntax:**
   ```javascript
   async function myAsyncFunction() {
     try {
       const result = await myPromise;
       // Code here executes after the promise is resolved
     } catch (error) {
       // Code here executes if the promise is rejected
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Readability:**
   - Async/await is often considered more readable and easier to understand than chaining promises.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Error handling can be done using a `try-catch` block, making it similar to synchronous error handling.

---

### Key Differences

1. **Syntactic Difference:**
   - Promises use `.then()` and `.catch()` for handling asynchronous operations, while async/await uses `async` functions with `await` to make asynchronous code look more like synchronous code.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Promises primarily use `.catch()` for error handling, while async/await uses `try-catch` blocks.

3. **Readability:**
   - Async/await is often considered more readable, especially for complex asynchronous code, as it resembles synchronous code.

4. **Chaining:**
   - While promises are chained using `.then()`, async/await provides a more linear and sequential flow of code.

### Usage

- Promises are more common in older code or libraries that were written before async/await was widely supported.
- Async/await is the preferred choice in modern JavaScript, as it simplifies asynchronous code and makes it more readable.
